# Spotify-Clone

Spotify-Clone was a project presented to IronHack as the conclusion of the third javascript module with contributions of Kelly Joany and Mario Tadakuma. This project was developed solely for the purpose of study and has no intention of infringing any copyright. There is no monetary gain and is a tribute to one of the most loved applications we use on a daily basis.

## History

This project was born from the desire to study react-sound. Users can listen to songs and select the albuns in a similar way to Spotify's navigation. The functions of play music, play music, repeat music, shuffle music, next music and prev music were implemented. Songs are automatically uploaded at the end of these :slightly_smiling_face:
